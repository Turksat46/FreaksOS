# FreaksOS

FreaksOS is an unfinished porating system, that is fully written in C and C++ from scratch.
With the UEFI Documentation, I am able to program such complex processes in a few lines of code.

I have huge plans with this, but I know, that it will never be good.
This is just one of my project, that I can show people to and be proud off.
